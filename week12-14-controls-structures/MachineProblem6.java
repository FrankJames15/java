            Design and develop a simple program for the Air Force to label an 
            aircraft as military of civilian. The program is to be given the plane’s 
            observed speed in km/h (kilometer per hour). The speed will serve as 
            its input. For planes traveling in excess of 1100 km/h, you should display 
            them as “ It’s a civilian aircraft”, between 500 km/h to 1100 km/h,display them as “ It’s a military aircraft!” and for planes traveling at 
            more slower speed – less than 500 km/h, you should display them as 
            an “ It’s a BIRD!”.
